Hello, my name is Will, and welcome to my website. I'm from Carmichael, California, and I go to Rio Americano High School. I really like music, writing, and hockey. I aspire to go to a four year college, and I want to get a job as a Public Relations Manager. 

My favourite musician is Mt. Joy. Their music is really comforting to me, and they are one of the bands that I would love to see in concert, because I feel like it would just be a great experience. Some other bands I like are Morgan Wallen, The Tragically Hip, Cigarettes After Sex, The Chats, Sum 41, Jack Johnson, and Red Hot Chilli Peppers. I play a couple intruments, and I love to sing.

I don't really have a favorite author, but I love to read poetry, historical fiction, and biographies. One of my favorite books is 'The Idiot" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. My favorite poet is either Frank Bidart or Robert Frost. I love to write poems, I try to write at least one a day, just to help myself get better at writing them.

I think my favorite hockey team would have to be the Washington Capitals. There's no real reason why, but whenever they're on, I will always try and watch them over any other team. I also really like the Ottawa Senators and the Boston Bruins. I've been to two NHL games so far, and they were both super fun. I love going to them because the atmosphere is so great.
