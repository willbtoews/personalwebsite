The light spreads over the meadow,
bright and sunny, causing everything it touches
to be bathed in happiness and light.

I watch from the middle as the animals
come out to play for the first time since 
winter started.

I watch the rabbits hop around with each other,
moving sporadically,
as if they were doing a jig.

I see deer frolicking among themselves,
moving as carefully as a ballet dancer
on the stage.

This is whaat love feels like.

I see him out of the corner of my eye,
as I was glancing around the meadow.

A young man, about my age,
also taking in the sights,
and the sounds of nature around us.

I see the way the sun hits him,
making it look as if he,
himself,
was the Sun.

Reflecting off of his hair,
making it look like he was 
Apollo himself.

He turns around,
meeting my eyes with his,
grabbing my attention,
and he smiles

This is the start of something new.
