The pictures come out beautiful.

I look at them, and there she is.

My model.

Standing tall and glowing in the sunlight.

The rays expanding around her like a halo, only adding to her angelic nature.

The pictures are close.

Showing her pores and every mole and discoloration on her dark brown skin.

The deep emerald dress she is wearing sticks to her lithe body like a second skin, the sleeves flowing in the wind.

She looks happy as she holds her arms wide.

As if she was welcoming the warmth and the light into her body.

She follows the sun as it rises and sets.

Moving her body so she stays in the bright rays.

Her body.

Brightened as she stands in the middle of the meadow.

A flower of the sun.
